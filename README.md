What It Does:
This tool helps you solve quadratic equations of the form axÂ² + bx + c = 0. Just enter the values for a, b, and c, and it will find the roots of the equation and show a graph of the function.

How to Use It:
Open the App: Open the index.html file in any web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

Enter Your Values:

Fill in the values for a, b, and c in the input boxes.
Make sure a is not zero.
Click "Calculate Roots":

This will show you the roots of the equation and a graph of the function.
Example
If you enter:

a = 1
b = -3
c = 2
You will see:

The roots are x = 2.00 and x = 1.00.
A graph of the equation.
How It Works
Checks Input: Ensures you entered numbers and a is not zero.
Finds Roots: Uses a formula to calculate the roots.
Shows Graph: Plots a graph of the equation for you to see.
